who are limited by current ML frameworks. Swift
   for TensorFlow's advantages include a seamless integration with a modern
   general-purpose language, allowing for more dynamic and sophisticated models.
   Fast abstractions can be developed "in user-space" (as opposed to in C/C++
   aka "framework-space"), resulting in modular APIs that can be easily
   customized.

2. **Î®∏Ïã†Îü¨Îãù ÌïôÏäµÏûê** who are just getting started with machine learning. Thanks to
   Swift's support for quality tooling (e.g. context-aware autocomplete), Swift
   for TensorFlow can be one of the most productive ways to get started learning
   the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Getting started

### Using Swift for TensorFlow

- **Google Colaboratory**: The fastest way to get started is to try out Swift
   for TensorFlow right in your browser. Just open up [a tutorial](#tutorials-), or start from a [blank
   notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/notebooks/blank_swift.ipynb)!
   Read more in our [usage guide](Usage.md).

- **Install locally**: you can [download a pre-built Swift for TensorFlow
   package](Installation.md). After installation, you can follow these
   [step-by-step instructions](Usage.md) to build and execute a Swift script on
   your computer.

- **Compile from source**: If you'd like to customize Swift for TensorFlow or
   contribute back, follow our [instructions](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow#building-swift-for-tensorflow)
   on building Swift for TensorFlow from source.

## Why Swift for TensorFlow?

Swift for TensorFlow is a new way to develop machine learning models. It
gives you the power of
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) directly integrated into the
[Swift programming language](https://swift.org/about). We believe that
machine learning paradigms are so important that they deserve
**first-class language and compiler support**.

A fundamental primitive in machine learning is gradient-based optimization:
computing function derivatives to optimize parameters. With Swift for
TensorFlow, you can easily differentiate functions using differential
operators like [`gradient(of:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Functions#/s:10TensorFlow8gradient2of15CotangentVectorQzxcq_xc_tAA14DifferentiableRzSFR_AaFR_AdaFPQy_Rs_r0_lF), or differentiate with respect to an entire
model by calling method [`gradient(in:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable#/s:10TensorFlow14DifferentiablePAAE8gradient2in15CotangentVectorQzqd__xXE_tSFRd__AaBRd__AfCQyd__Rsd__lF). These differentiation APIs
are not just available for `Tensor`-related concepts‚Äîthey are
generalized for all types that conform to the [`Differentiable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable)
protocol, including `Float`, `Double`, SIMD vectors, and your own data
structures.

```swift
// Custom differentiable type.
struct Model: Differentiable {
    var w: Float
    var b: Float
    func applied(to input: Float) -> Float {
        return w * input + b
    }
}

// Differentiate using `Differentiable.gradient(at:in:)`.
let model = Model(w: 4.0, b: 3.0)
let (ùõÅmodel, ùõÅinput) = model.gradient(at: 2.0) { model, input in
    model.applied(to: input)
}

print(ùõÅmodel) // Model.AllDifferentiableVariables(w: 2.0, b: 1.0)
print(ùõÅinput) // 4.0
```

Beyond derivatives, the Swift for TensorFlow project comes with a sophisticated toolchain
to make users more productive. You can run Swift interactively in a Jupyter
notebook, and get helpful autocomplete suggestions to help you explore the
massive API surface of a modern deep learning library. You can [get started
right in your browser in
seconds](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/site/tutorials/model_training_walkthrough.ipynb)!

Migrating to Swift for TensorFlow is really easy thanks to Swift's powerful
Python integration. You can incrementally migrate your Python code over (or
continue to use your favorite Python libraries), because you can easily call
your favorite Python library with a familiar syntax:

```swift
import TensorFlow
import Python

let np = Python.import("numpy")

let array = np.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)  // Create a 10x10 numpy array.
let tensor = Tensor<Float>(numpy: array)  // Seamless integration!
```

## Source code

Compiler and standard library development happens on the `tensorflow` branch of
the [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow) repository.

Additional code repositories that make up the core of the project include:

 - [Swift fork of LLDB](http://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/tree/tensorflow):
   debugger and REPL support.
 - [Deep learning library](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis): high-level
   API familiar to Keras users.

> Swift for TensorFlow is **not** intended to remain a long-term fork of the official
> Swift language. Language additions are designed to fit with the direction of
> Swift and will go through the [Swift
> Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution) process.
